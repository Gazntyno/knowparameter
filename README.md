# technature.io
The Website for Technature. 
This website will display The philosophy of technature and "thinking outside the sim"
as well as be the place for people to buy technature merch. 

I also want to showcase art made with artificial intelligence with quotes from the greatest thinkers. 

I want the website to have a high tech feel to it. There will be animated transistors and semiconductors throughout the website with the added touch of vines and leaves. 

The concept of Technature will further develop and evolve as the website is built. 

Features: 

- AI art showcase 
- The ability to sign up and make an account 
- Blog 
- Contact Info
- Merch Shop

- I eventually want to allow the users to upload their own AI Art to showcase what they've made
- I'm going to make a 3-D model of a microchip to use for this project.
